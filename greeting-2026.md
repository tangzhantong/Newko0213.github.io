        <h1>2026 Greeting</h1>
        <p>2025 was an important year for me—graduation season and planning for the future. My goal is clear: to continue pursuing a doctoral degree. Fortunately, although there were twists and turns, everything went smoothly.</p>
        <p>2025 was very crucial for me. I completed the experimental part of my graduation thesis in half a year and learned codes related to single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics, which was very interesting!</p>
        <p> regarding biological research, China always lacks 0-1 original research. We must face the gap squarely, but this is also the challenge that our generation needs to take on.</p>
        <p>I still firmly believe that the 21st century is the century of biology, but if you ask me when? It is right now!</p>
